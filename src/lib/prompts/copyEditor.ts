"Cyclone Mocha brought some additional uncertainty to the agriculture sector. The storm hit in Sittwe, the capital of Rakhine, and then moved northeast through Chin, Magway, Sagaing and Kachin. The farmers' livelihoods were severely affected due to the loss of livestock. In early May 2023, in Magway, farmers had already planted green gram and sesame but damage was caused to the crops through extensive flooding, meaning much was lost. Cash crops like sesame and green gram are typically cultivated by farmers to supplement their families' diets and generate income."
